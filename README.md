# Slide Puzzle

Simple Slide Puzzle Game with p5.js library. At the beggining, i implemented using two-dim array. Then i realize that one-dim array could more efficent than two-dim. So i reimplemeted. You can still access the two-dim version on a different branch.

Shuffling was the problem. The easiest way to do that is making random legal moves. Thus, you don't worry about is puzzle solvable or not. I tried to shuffle through taking random tiles and change the indexes. Then i was going to check is puzzle solvable. Checking method that i used had some issues with NxP puzzles.
